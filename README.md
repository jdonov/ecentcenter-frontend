EVENT CENTER APP


Idea

Event center app lets you to create your own events, send invitations by email and join public events, created by other users. 
This is an author's project from ReactJS course, organized by Softuni - https://softuni.bg/trainings/3023/reactjs--june-2020/internal .


Main technologies

    • Front-end – ReactJS, Javascript, CSS, HTML
    • Back-end – Backendless (REST API and Email API) - cloud backend platform 


How it works

If you are registered user you will be able to create your own events. There are two types of events:

    • public event - all registered users in the application will be able to see it and join it, and you can see the list of joined attendees.
    
    • private event -  visible only for those who have a link to it. You can create a list of attendees and send them invitations by email. Attendees can confirm or reject your invitation and the response will be visible for you.
Otherwise as registered user you can see (and search for) all public events and join them.
Unregistered users can see (and search for) all public events and their details, but can’t join them. Also they can reply to private invitations, sending to them, but can’t create their own events.
